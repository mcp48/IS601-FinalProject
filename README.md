# IS 601 Final Project
The goal of this project is to create a flask application that is based on the tutorial found at https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application.  The scope and data for the project is based on an earlier project, found on my GitHub at https://github.com/mcp48/IS601-Project3.  The data from that project was modified to follow with the instructions in the tutorial mentioned in the above link.
