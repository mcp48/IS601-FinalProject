# IS 601 Final Project
The goal of this project is to create a flask application that is based on the tutorial found at https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application.  The scope and data for the project is based on an earlier project, found on my GitHub at https://github.com/mcp48/IS601-Project3.  The data from that project was modified to follow with the instructions in the tutorial mentioned in the above link.

Also, a note to the professor and TA's.  Rather than just modify my current project, I found it easier to create a new project from scratch, and copy and paste the original code from project 3 to start off, then modify that from there.  Before creating any new branches, all the commits and code I pasted in from project 3 was in the master branch.
